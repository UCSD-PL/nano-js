Build the tests:
To build the tests you need 3 binaries:
-hscg: converts JS into a Haskell data structure. You can find the source code of that
 binary in the testfiles folder.
-run: this is a shell script that will run a modified version of th ts compiler
 that prints the AST in XML on stdout. You can find it in the nano-ts repo.
-Parse: converts XML into a Haskell data structure. You can find it in this same folder

If you have both repositories (nano-ts and nano-js) in the same folder (i.e. at the
same level), the make file should work directly.
Run make test.
This will build Parse, hscg and execue the three binaries on the corresponding files.

Otherwise, you can run the python script test.py (in testfiles) by hand.
Run python test.py --help for the options.
If the paths of the files are different, use the -DGLOBAL=VALUE option to indicate 
where the required binaries and tests are. You can find the four global variables
to set at th begining of the python script.
